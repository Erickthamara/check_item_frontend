## Check Item App

This an app that helps check if an item is in stock. It calls a flask API we built to get the data.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
